- **Important**:
As you know, [TWBS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) had changed their policies about development and maintenance of version 4.x and they will merge shipped changes in official `v4-dev` branch. Because of their unplanned merges, next RTL revisions will not have been provided weekly. ðŸ˜ž
